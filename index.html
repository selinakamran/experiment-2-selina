                <h3>Darius and Orion</h3>
                    <p>Orion is the former Professor at Zodiac Academy. He gets fired after the dean and student body learns of his relationship with Darcy. He takes the blame and goes to Darkmore penitentiary. Later in the series we learn that the two are Elysian Mated (soulmates choosen by the Stars). <br>
                        Darius is one of four Heirs of the Solarian Throne. He refuses his attraction with Tory and continually ridicules her infront of everyone causing them to become enemies. Darius refuses to bow to the True Queens, Darcy and Tory, but later in the Series after he is brought back to life from the dead by Tory, he bows to her infront of all of Solaria.</p>
